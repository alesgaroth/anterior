We want exte to support conditional get
either through Last-Modified header and If-Modified-Since:
or through Etag: and If-Non-Match:

For the full effect: we would have to say that if the template changed, it changed, so Last-Modified and Etag change
if any of the data that is filled into the template changes, it changed.

We may need to use a Weak Etag so we can include a datestamp of when the last time the page was rendered.
